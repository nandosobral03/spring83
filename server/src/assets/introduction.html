        running for a year now without any issues.

      <h2>Standards for publishing</h2>
      <p>
        This server has certain restrictions in place to ensure a positive and
        safe environment. Firstly, it prohibits boards that contain abusive or
        discriminatory language or imagery. Secondly, it does not allow boards
        that promote or link to resources supporting abuse or discrimination.
        Additionally, engaging in illegal activities is strictly forbidden.

        If you come across any boards that violate these rules, you can report
        them using the provided address. I reserve the right to remove any
        boards that violate these rules.
